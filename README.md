Seminar in Investing - Left-tail risk

This study examines whether left-tail risk explains the return patterns observed in stocks sorted by the RSJ measure and how its decomposition into continuous and jump components affects return predictability. 
Specifically, it investigates whether stocks with left-tail risk primarily driven by price jumps exhibit stronger and more persistent underperformance than those where downside risk arises from continuous price movements.
